Arduino Uno (Transmitter) with RX470C-V01:

VCC -> 5V (from Arduino)
GND -> GND (from Arduino)
Data Pin (Usually, this pin is the one used for transmitting) -> Use a digital pin, e.g., Pin 3



ESP32 (Receiver) with RX470C-V01:

VCC -> 3.3V (from ESP32)
GND -> GND (from ESP32)
Data Pin -> Use a digital pin, e.g., Pin 22
